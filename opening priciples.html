    <h2>Opening Principles</h2>
    <p>Every great chess game begins with a solid foundation. Here are the essential principles to guide your opening play:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Control the Center:</strong> Use pawns and pieces to dominate central squares (e4, d4, e5, d5).</li>
      <li><strong>Develop Your Pieces:</strong> Bring out knights and bishops early — avoid moving the same piece twice.</li>
      <li><strong>King Safety:</strong> Castle early to protect your king and connect your rooks.</li>
      <li><strong>Don’t Move Too Many Pawns:</strong> Focus on piece activity rather than excessive pawn moves.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Early Queen Moves:</strong> Don’t expose your queen too soon — it can become a target.</li>
      <li><strong>Think Ahead:</strong> Every move should support your long-term strategy and piece coordination.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Follow these principles and you'll enter the middlegame with confidence and control.</p>
