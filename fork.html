    <h2>Fork</h2>
    <p>A fork is a powerful tactic where one piece attacks two or more enemy pieces at the same time. Knights are especially good at creating forks due to their unique movement.</p>

    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Multi-threat:</strong> One piece targets multiple pieces simultaneously.</li>
      <li><strong>Pressure:</strong> The opponent often cannot save all threatened pieces.</li>
      <li><strong>Common Forkers:</strong> Knights, pawns, and queens.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example Position</h3>
    <p>A knight on e5 jumps to c6, attacking both the king and rook — a classic fork!</p>

    <p>Forks are especially effective when the opponent’s pieces are close together. Train your tactical eye to spot these opportunities!</p>
