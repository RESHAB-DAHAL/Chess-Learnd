    <h2>Zwischenzug</h2>
    <p><em>Zwischenzug</em> (German for "in-between move") is a surprising intermediate move played before an expected sequence. It interrupts the opponent’s plan and often turns the tables.</p>

    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Interruptive Tactic:</strong> Played in the middle of a forcing line.</li>
      <li><strong>Surprise Factor:</strong> Catches opponents off guard by changing the tempo.</li>
      <li><strong>Game-Changer:</strong> Can shift the evaluation of a position dramatically.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example Position</h3>
    <p>Black expects White to capture a rook, but instead white plays Reb8+ giving a check — forcing the king to move — and only then white captures, being at a 2-point advantage from a 3-point disadvantage.</p>
    <h3>Tips for Using Zwischenzug</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Look for forcing moves (checks, threats) before automatic recaptures.</li>
      <li>Use zwischenzugs to disrupt combinations or escape pins.</li>
      <li>Always ask: “Do I have a better move before continuing the sequence?”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Zwischenzug is a hallmark of advanced tactical awareness. Spotting these moments can elevate your play and surprise even strong opponents.</p>
