    <h2>Discovered Attack</h2>
    <p>A discovered attack occurs when moving one piece reveals an attack from another piece behind it. This tactic can be devastating, especially when the revealed attack targets a high-value piece or delivers check.</p>

    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hidden Power:</strong> The attacking piece is initially blocked by a friendly piece.</li>
      <li><strong>Trigger Move:</strong> The front piece moves, often with its own threat, revealing the attack.</li>
      <li><strong>Double Trouble:</strong> The opponent must respond to both threats, often losing material.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example Position</h3>
    <p>Imagine a bishop on b2 and a pawn on c3. When the pawn moves to c4, the bishop suddenly attacks a rook on g7 — a classic discovered attack.</p>

    <h3>Tips for Using Discovered Attacks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Look for aligned pieces (rooks, bishops, queens) behind pawns or minor pieces.</li>
      <li>Use the front piece to create a secondary threat — forks work well here.</li>
      <li>Discovered checks are especially powerful, often forcing the king to move.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Train your eye to spot hidden attackers waiting to be unleashed. Discovered attacks can flip the game in a single move.</p>
