    <h2>Double Attack</h2>
    <p>A double attack is a tactic where one move creates two simultaneous threats. It’s a broader concept that includes forks and discovered attacks.</p>

    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Two Threats:</strong> The opponent must respond to both.</li>
      <li><strong>Overload:</strong> Often forces a concession or loss of material.</li>
      <li><strong>Common Types:</strong> Forks, checks + captures, threats + pins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example Position</h3>
    <p>A queen moves to h5, threatening checkmate on h7 and attacking a loose bishop on b5 — a double attack!</p>

    <p>Double attacks are versatile and can be created by any piece. Look for ways to combine threats in a single move.</p>
